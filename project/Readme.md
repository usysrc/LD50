# Story
While digging we found rare sky crystals that can be used to stop all other movement in the sky.

The skypirates want the crystals and are attacking us with skydiving pirates.

We are a peaceful town. 
Use the crystals in the beacon to stop time while the invaders come pooring from the sky.
We need to gather resources and build defenses to delay the invaders.

2 Parts: 
- On the ground: gather resources
- In the air on our skyship: build fortifications on the sky islands
